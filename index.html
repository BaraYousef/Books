          The 48 Laws of Power
Greene's first book, The 48 Laws of Power, first published in 1998, is a practical guide for anyone who wants power, observes power, or wants to arm themselves against power.[8] The laws are a distillation of 3,000 years in the history of power, drawing on the lives of strategists and historical figures like Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, Haile Selassie I, Carl von Clausewitz, Queen Elizabeth I, Henry Kissinger, and P.T. Barnum.[9][10] Each law has its own chapter, complete with a "transgression of the law," "observance of the law," and/or a "reversal."</p>

  Main article: The Art of Seduction
Greene's second book, The Art of Seduction, was published in 2001.[12] The book profiles the nine types of seducers (e.g. The Rake, The Siren, and The Charmer) and details aspects of attraction, authenticity, storytelling, and negotiation.[13][14] Greene uses examples from historical figures such as Cleopatra, Giacomo Casanova, Duke Ellington and John F. Kennedy to support the psychology behind seduction.[15][16]

The Art of Seduction is mentioned in Neil Strauss' book The Game as a recommended book in the seduction community.[17] It has sold more than 500,000 copies.[18]
